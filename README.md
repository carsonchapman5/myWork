A repository of some of the work I have done ranging from Functional Programming to Imperative Programming.
Includes projects ranging in the in the languages:
        - Java        (String background with JUnit and algorithms)\n
        - Python      (Doing mostly interactive work with tkinter)
        - C           (Highly profficient, have created a pipelined CPU using C) 
        - HTML/CSS/JS (mainly took use of the processing library for canvas projects)
